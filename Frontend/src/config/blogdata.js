        "If you are like me you love looking out of the window of a plane. You also constantly wonder on which side of the plane are the gorgeous views. I was curious about my Delhi Paro Druk Air flight and randomly choose my seat and I was rewarded but let me take the guesswork out for you.\n On the Delhi Paro flight the views are on the A side of the window seat. If you like to include the wing of the plane in the shot, once again like me, you will have to pick up a seat at the back of the plane. If you don’t care about the wing, you can choose any seat on the A side. Just be careful about sitting on the wing as sometimes it can completely block the view. I got a fabulous view of Mt. Kanchengunja while going to Paro. ",

      title: 'The Mumbai To Goa Cruise Ferry Finally Begins Its Trial & The Final Prices Start @ INR 7,000',

        "The Mumbai to Goa cruise ferry, which is India’s first cruise service has finally started to sail. The trial run happened this Wednesday, i.e. 23rd May wherein the cruise left from Mumbai in the evening and reached Goa the next day in the morning. So, if you and your friends have been planning a trip to Goa, we suggest you wait a little more as the cruise services will open soon for the public, and it’s definitely going to be one hell of an experience! Although the service was expected to launch in December, as per the chairman of Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) “The delay is mainly because of certification and that the vessel is being readied. IRS and DG shipping clearances are pending. These formalities have to be completed.” There were also a few other causes for the delay in the commencement of the Mumbai to Goa cruise ferry, which was earlier scheduled to launch by December 2017 like the delay in obtaining dry docking permissions in Mumbai and modification of the on-board safety apparatus among others. But now that the trial run has been successfully ticked off too, the cruise shall start its tourist operations soon.",

        "Chhavi and I traveled to The Himalayan Shire near Fagu at the beginning of February for short non-tennis Holiday! And how we cherish that time spent in the beautiful surroundings of the Himalayan Shire in Himachal Pradesh. It is quite close to Shimla, Kufri and Fagu. The Himalayan Shire is a 7 room, tastefully done, luxury homestay owned by Rishabh Goel. He was there to greet us when we arrived at the property in the evening. We took the Kalka Shatabdi Express train till Chandigarh and then a taxi to The Himalayan Shire. The Chai and Pakora was a welcome site to us after the long journey. Refreshed we headed to the coolest part of the homestay. Above the second floor common area is the most charming corner of the homestay, you can take the stairs to the attic for the coolest view of the majestic mountains. My joy knew no bounds when they served us evening tea there. Chhavi and I would head up and lounge around to our hearts content at every opportunity. You have to check it out. The Deodar Suite at the Himalayan Shire We stayed at the Deodar Suite at the Himalayan Shire. It is a huge room with a huge bathroom. I loved so many things about our room. At the top of our list was the electric fireplace. In spite of traveling a good bit I never got to stay in a room with the fireplace! So, this was a first for both Chhavi and me. And we loved it. It was cold out there in February. There was still a bit of snow in the corners that didn’t get direct sunlight.The electric blanket on the bed was the most used and useful feature! On the cold nights it was a lifesaver. After a while we would switch if off though. So even though the room was huge and the weather cold, we were always warm and cozy! The food is cooked fresh and they always ask your choice. We enjoyed all our meals. Chhavi gives a special shout out to pancakes. I really enjoyed breadrolls and parathas! We had Manchurian and fried rice for one meal which was delicious. Otherwise, we enjoyed Indian meals. Chhavi is also giving a shout out to the Maggi she ate in the evening!",

      description:
        "Situated in Coastal Karnataka, Udupi is popularly known for its temples and tempting cuisine. At the heart of the town lies the Sri Krishna Mutt. Established by Shri Madhavacharya in the 13th century, the temple is surrounded by 8 Mutts and is visited throughout the year by pilgrims.  On the premises of the same temple are two other ancient Shiva temples of Udupi that often go unnoticed.They are the twin Shaivite temples called Anantheshwara and Chandramoulishwara. The presence of these temples made Udupi a holy land even before the establishment of the Shri Krishna Mutt. It is customary to visit them before proceeding toward the Shri Krishna temple.Shiva Temples of Udupi The Chandramoulishwara Temple The history of the temples is intertwined with the name Udupi. The name “Udupi” is derived from the Sanskrit term “Udupa”. This literally translates to the “Lord of the stars”, the Moon. According to popular legend, the moon was married to 27 daughters (signifying the 27 constellations) of Daksh Prajapati. While the moon enjoyed the company of Rohini, he ended up ignoring the other 26 wives. On complaining to their father, Daksh Prajapati cursed the moon that his radiance will diminish and will be lost in total oblivion. To atone for this curse, the moon started performing penance and austerities to Shiva Mahadev.",

      title: 'LADAKH IN WINTER – MINI ROAD TRIPS TO TOURIST ATTRACTIONS',

      description:
        "Ladakh in Winter typically means Chadar Trek. But not all of us can do trekking in the extreme weather of Ladakh winters. Does this mean Ladakh is out of bounds for us in winter? Thankfully No. There are mini road trips that you can do with Leh as your base location in the region. Where you can comfortably stay in centrally heated hotels like our host The Grand Dragon Hotel. I spent 4 days in Ladakh to discover these absolutely scenic road trips from Leh. Chilling is the starting point of the famous Chadar Trek that happens in winter on the Zanskar River when it is frozen. And trekkers walk on this frozen river. However, if like me, you are not the trekking kind fellow, but still, want to enjoy the river & mountain landscape of Ladakh in Winter – take a short drive to Chilling. That takes you along the Zanskar River. Confluence Point of Zanskar & Indus River – Ladakh in Winter On this drive, you must include the confluence point of the Zanskar and Indus Rivers. This is one of the most beautiful and discreet confluences that I have seen. Muddy green Indus flows from Leh and merges with the pristine blue Zanskar. For a distance, the waters flow in parallel. Demarcated by a thin layer of frozen water, as if moving together while remaining independent.",
